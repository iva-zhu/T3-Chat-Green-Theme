# MacOS Green Theme for T3.Chat

This is a custom CSS theme that changes the color of "Send Message", "New Chat", and "Search" buttons in T3.Chat to a macOS-inspired green, making them more visually appealing and less distracting than the default pink.

It's designed to be applied using the [Stylus browser extension](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus).

## How to Install

To use this theme, you need the **Stylus** browser extension. Stylus allows you to apply custom CSS styles to websites.

1.  **Install Stylus Extension:**
    *   For **Firefox**: Get it from the [Mozilla Add-ons store](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/).
    *   For **Chrome/Edge/Brave**: Get it from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne).

2.  **Open Stylus Editor for T3.Chat:**
    *   Go to [T3.Chat](https://t3.chat/).
    *   Click on the **Stylus icon** in your browser's toolbar (usually a square "S" or a pencil icon).
    *   In the pop-up, click on **"Write style for: t3.chat"**. This will open a new tab with the Stylus editor.

3.  **Copy and Paste the CSS Code:**
    *   Go to the `t3-chat-green.css` file in [this repository](https://github.com/iva-zhu/T3-Chat-Green-Theme/blob/main/t3-chat-green.css)
    *   Click on the "Raw" button to get the plain text version of the CSS.
    *   **Copy ALL** the code from that raw page.
    *   Go back to the Stylus editor tab. **Delete any existing code** in the large white editor field, and then **paste** the copied CSS code.

4.  **Save the Style:**
    *   Make sure the **"Enabled" checkbox** (usually in the top-left of the Stylus editor) is checked.
    *   Give your style a name in the left sidebar (e.g., "T3.Chat Green").
    *   Click the **"Save" button**.

5.  **Enjoy!**
    *   Return to your T3.Chat tab and refresh the page (Cmd+R on Mac).
    *   Your "Send Message", "New Chat", and "Search" buttons should now be a beautiful macOS green!
